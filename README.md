# Quake Champions Map Veto

This is a cross-platform and web application to make map veto for the game Quake Champions.  
Modus pointed out this was a thing, I edited it to include QC assets/map names. 

Thank you Akiver for creating this lovely tool 

## Usage

Once we finish updating this to fully match QC tournament formats and theme, there will be a web version as well as downloadable desktop releases.
